amanda-compatibility \- Compatibility between Amanda versions
.SH "NETWORK COMPATIBILITY"
.PP
Amanda has used several on\-the\-wire protocols to communicate between the server and backup clients, and not all of them have been compatible\&.
.PP
Versions of Amanda prior to about 2\&.3 used a different protocol which is not compatible\&. 2\&.3 is very old so this is not of general interest\&.
.PP
The Amanda 2\&.4 series all use the same protocol\&. This protocol has support for extensibility\&. Generally upgrading clients or servers along the 2\&.4 branch does not cause difficulty\&.
.PP
Amanda 2\&.5\&.0 uses the same protocol as 2\&.4\&. One can use a 2\&.5\&.0 server with 2\&.4 clients and a 2\&.4 server with 2\&.5\&.0 clients\&.
.PP
Kerberos4 authentication in 2\&.5 is compatible with 2\&.4\&. In 2\&.5, kerberos4 encryption is broken, at least for the server\&.
.PP
Amanda 2\&.5\&.1 introduced a new recover protocol\&. Backup communication works with any combination of versions, but 2\&.5\&.1\*(Aqs amrecover cannot communicate with an older server\&. Use oldamrecover on 2\&.5\&.1 and higher clients when communicating with an older server\&.
.PP
Amanda 2\&.6\&.0 and later are completely compatible with 2\&.5\&.1\&.
.PP
To restore a dump created with the tapesplit_size option using amrecover, you need at least a 2\&.5 server and late\-2\&.4 client\&. (Extracting that backup using only shell, mt and dd is also possible\&.)
.SH "UPGRADES"
.PP
The recommended course for Amanda upgrades is to upgrade the server first, and test backups and restores before upgrading clients\&. Consult the changes described below for the relevant span of versions to determine what adjustments, if any, are required\&. Also see the NEWS file shipped with each Amanda release for more detailed information\&.

Dumptype parameters
\fBtape\-splitsize\fR,
\fBsplit\-diskbuffer\fR, and
\fBfallback\-splitsize\fR
\- see
\fBallow\-split\fR
and tapetype parameters
\fBpart\-size\fR,
\fBpart\-cache\-type\fR,
\fBpart\-cache\-dir\fR, and
\fBpart\-cache\-max\-size\fR\&. See
\fBamanda.conf\fR(5)
for more information on these new parameters, noting particularly that all but the first are tapetype parameters, not dumptype parameters\&.
.sp
To convert most cases to the new parameters, set
\fBpart\-size\fR
to the old value of
\fBtape\-splitsize\fR
and
\fBpart\-cache\-dir\fR
to the old value of
\fBsplit\-diskbuffer\fR, if present\&. If
\fBsplit\-diskbuffer\fR
was set, then set
\fBpart\-cache\-type\fR
to
\fBdisk\fR, otherwise
\fBmemory\fR\&. Finally, if using memory caching, set
\fBpart\-cache\-max\-size\fR
to the previous value of
\fBfallback\-splitsize\fR\&. Be sure to remove all of the old keywords from your configuration\&.

.PP
Although it is a significant rewrite, there are no incompatible changes in this release\&.
.PP
Old\-style changer scripts are deprecated in this release\&. While they remain available, they may be removed in a future release\&. Consider upgrading to one of the new changer scripts\&. Users of
\fIchg\-zd\-mtx\fR
are particularly encouraged to consider the much more intelligent
\fIchg\-robot\fR\&. See
\fBamanda-changers\fR(7)

amverify

amverifyrun
are removed and replaced with
\fBamcheckdump\fR(8)\&. Both
amdd
and
ammt
are removed\&.
.PP
Some Amanda files are now installed in new
amanda/
subdirectories: libraries are now installed in
$libdir/amanda
and internal programs are now installed in
$libexecdir/amanda\&.
.PP
The amandates file, previously at
/etc/amandates, is now at
$localstatedir/amanda/amandates\&. You may want to move your existing
/etc/amandates
when you upgrade Amanda\&.
.PP
GLib is now required to build and run Amanda\&.

.SH "NAME"
amsamba \- Amanda Application to interface with smbclient
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Amsamba is an Amanda Application API script\&. It should not be run by users directly\&. It uses smbclient to backup and restore data\&.
.PP
The
\fBdiskdevice\fR
in the disklist (DLE) must have the form \*(Aq//CIFSHOST/SHARE/SUBDIR\*(Aq where CIFSHOST is the CIFS host containing the data to be backed up, SHARE is the share to connect, and subdir is the subdirectory to backup\&. \*(Aq/subdir\*(Aq can be ommited, in which case the complete share is archived\&.
.PP
Unlike most applications, amsamba backs up and restores data located on a different system from that where amsamba itself runs\&. The host containing the data is the CIFS host\&. In practice, amsamba is usually run on the same system as the Amanda server, with a DLE like
.sp
.nf
localhost "//CIFSHOST/SHARENAME" amsamba\-dumptype
.fi
.PP
Include or exclude can be used, but not both\&. The path for \*(Aqexclude list\*(Aq or \*(Aqinclude list\*(Aq must be absolute path on the CIFS host\&. The estimate calculates the complete size of the share, without regard for include or exclude directives\&. It will be larger than the actual dump if you use include or exclude\&. Using \*(Aqestimate server\*(Aq in the dumptype could give better estimate\&.
.SH "PROPERTIES"
.PP
This section lists the properties that control amsamba\*(Aqs functionality\&. See
\fBamanda-applications\fR(7)
for information on application properties and how they are configured\&.
.PP
SMBCLIENT\-PATH
.RS 4

The path to the smbclient binary\&.  The default is set when Amanda is built by the 
\-\-with\-smbclient configure option\&.
.RE
.PP
GNUTAR\-PATH
.RS 4

The path to the gnutar binary\&.  The default is set when Amanda is built by the 
\-\-with\-gnutar configure option\&. gnutar is used to create the index\&.
.RE
.PP
AMANDAPASS
.RS 4

Location of the amandapass file, defaulting to "$CONFIG_DIR/amandapass"\&.
Relative pathnames are relative to the configuration directory,
"$CONFIG_DIR/<config>"\&. 
Note that this file is located on the client, not on the server\&.
The format of the file is as follow:
.nf
  Sharename User%Password Domain
.fi

Sharename is \*(Aq//HOST/SHARE\*(Aq without the SUBDIR\&.
Sharename can be quoted,
it can be \*(Aq*\*(Aq to match all share,
it can be \*(Aq//pc\-host/*\*(Aq to match all share on pc\-host\&.
User is the username use to connect to the share\&.
Password is the password use to connect to the share\&.
\*(Aq%Password\*(Aq is optional if the user can connect to the share without password\&.
\*(AqUser%Password\*(Aq is optional, the user \*(Aqguest\*(Aq without password is use to connect to the share\&.
Domain is optional\&. Example:
.nf
  //another\-pc/share otheruser%otherpw domain
  //another\-pc/share otheruser%otherpw
  //another\-pc/share myuser mydomain
  //another\-pc/share myuser
  //another\-pc/share
.fi
.RE
.PP
ALLOW\-ANONYMOUS
.RS 4

This username without password is used to connect to the share if no matching entry is found in the amandapass file\&.
.RE
.PP
DIRECTORY
.RS 4

For restore command only, the data is recoved in that directory\&. Must be a unix path for "tar" RECOVER\-MODE or a smb path for "smb" recover\-MODE\&.
.RE
.PP
RECOVER\-MODE
.RS 4

"tar" or "smb", default to "tar"\&. If "tar", the data is recovered on the local machine, If "smb", the data is recovered on the smb client machine\&.
.RE
.SH "INCLUDE AND EXCLUDE LISTS"
.PP
This application supplies exclude lists via the
\fBsmbclient\fR
\fB\-TX\fR
option\&. Normal shell\-style wildcard expressions, using * and ?, are not supported\&. All expressions are matched only from the base directory of the DLE\&. Expressions that match a directory may have a leading or trailing "/"\&. Example expressions:
.sp
.nf
  \&./temp\-files           # exclude top\-level dir "temp\-files" entirely
  \&./temp\-files/          # same
  /temp\-files            # same
  temp\-files             # same
  \&./temp\-files/*         # BAD: does nothing
  *\&.iso                  # BAD: does nothing
  proxy/local/cache      # exclude "cache" in dir "proxy/local"
.fi
.PP
Include lists are supported only if excludes are not given\&. They are handled via the
\fBsmbclient\fR
\fB\-TI\fR
option\&. Include matching is identical to the exclude matching described above\&.
.SH "EXAMPLE"
.nf
  define application app_amsamba {
    property "SMBCLIENT\-PATH" "/usr/bin/smbclient"
    property "GNUTAR\-PATH" "/bin/tar"
    property "AMANDAPASS" /etc/amandapass"
    property "ALLOW\-ANONYMOUS" "guest"

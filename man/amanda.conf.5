.SH "NAME"
amanda.conf \- Main configuration file for Amanda, the Advanced Maryland Automatic Network Disk Archiver
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBamanda.conf\fR(5)
is the main configuration file for Amanda\&. This manpage lists the relevant sections and parameters of this file for quick reference\&.
.PP
The file
\fB<CONFIG_DIR>/<config>/amanda\&.conf\fR
is loaded\&.
.SH "SYNTAX"
.PP
There are a number of configuration parameters that control the behavior of the Amanda programs\&. All have default values, so you need not specify the parameter in
\fBamanda\&.conf\fR
if the default is suitable\&.
.SS "COMMENTS"
.PP
Lines starting with # are ignored, as are blank lines\&. Comments may be placed on a line with a directive by starting the comment with a #\&. The remainder of the line is ignored\&.
.SS "KEYWORDS AND IDENTIFIERS"
.PP
Keywords are case insensitive, i\&.e\&.
\fBmailto\fR
and
\fBMailTo\fR
are treated the same\&. Also, the characters \*(Aq\fB\-\fR\*(Aq and \*(Aq\fB_\fR\*(Aq are interchangeable in all predefined Amanda keywords:
\fBdevice_property\fR
and
\fBdevice\-property\fR
have the same meaning\&. This manpage uses the dashed versions, but the underscored versions will be accepted for backward compatibility
.PP
Identifiers are names which are defined in the configuration itself, such as dumptypes or interfaces\&. Identifiers are are case\-insensitive, but sensitive to \*(Aq\fB\-\fR\*(Aq vs\&. \*(Aq\fB_\fR\*(Aq\&. Identifiers should be quoted in the configuration file, although For historical reasons, the quotes are optional\&.
.PP
Strings are always quoted with double quotes ("), and any double quotes or backslashes within the string are escaped with a backslash:
.sp
.nf
tapelist "/path/to/tapelist"
property "escaped\-string" "escaping: \e\e (backslash) and \e" (double\-quote)"
.fi
.PP
To summarize, then:
.sp
.nf
                          # QUOTES        CASE            \-/_
logdir "logs"             # required      sensitive       sensitive
send\-amreport\-on strange  # prohibited    insensitive     insensitive
tapetype "EXABYTE"        # optional      insensitive     sensitive

define dumptype "dt" {    # optional      insensitive     sensitive
  "dumptype\-common"       # optional      insensitive     sensitive
  strategy noinc          # prohibited    insensitive     insensitive
}
.fi
.SS "VALUE SUFFIXES"
.PP
Integer arguments may have one of the following (case insensitive) suffixes, some of which have a multiplier effect:
.PP
\fBb byte bytes\fR
.RS 4
Some number of bytes\&.

.ps +1
\fBNote\fR
.ps -1
.br
The value
\fBinf\fR
may be used in most places where an integer is expected to mean an infinite amount\&.
.sp
Boolean arguments may have any of the values
\fB1\fR,
\fBy\fR,
\fByes\fR,
\fBt\fR,
\fBtrue\fR
or
\fBon\fR
to indicate a true state, or
\fB0\fR,
\fBn\fR,
\fBno\fR,
\fBf\fR,
\fBfalse\fR
or
\fBoff\fR
to indicate a false state\&. If no argument is given,
\fBtrue\fR
is assumed\&.
.sp .5v
.RE
.RE
.SS "PARAMETER ORDER"
.PP
In general, the order in which parameters occur in the configuration file does not matter, with the exception of subsection inheritance\&. For example, if dumptype "normal\-encrypt" which inherits from dumptype "normal", then "normal" must appear first in the configuration file\&.
.SS "STRINGS"
.PP
Quoted strings in Amanda follow a common, C\-like syntax\&. Printable characters and whitespace are kept as\-is, except that the backslash character (\e) is used as an escape character, and a double\-quote ends the string\&. The allowed escape sequences are
.sp
.nf
    ESCAPE SEQUENCE     BECOMES
    \e\e                  \e
    \e"                  "
    \en                  (newline)
    \et                  (tab)
    \er                  (carriage return)
    \ef                  (form\-feed)
    \e1 \- \e7
    \e01 \- \e77
    \e001 \- \e377         (character specified in octal)
.fi
Illegally quoted strings are handled on a "best\-effort" basis, which may lead to unexpected results\&.
.PP
Examples:
.sp
.nf
finserver "/data/finance/XYZ Corp\*(Aqs \e"real\e" finances" finance\-high eth0 \-1
property "syspath" "C:\e\eWINDOWS\e\eSYSTEM"
.fi
.SS "SUBSECTIONS AND INHERITANCE"
.PP
Amanda configuration files may include various
\fIsubsections\fR, each defining a set of configuration directives\&. Each type of subsection is described below\&. Note that all types of subsections can
\fIinherit\fR
from other subsections of the same type by naming the "parent" section in the "child" subsection\&. For example:
.sp
.nf
define dumptype global {
    record yes
    index yes
}

define dumptype nocomp {
    global      # inherit the parameters in dumptype \*(Aqglobal\*(Aq
    compress none
}
.fi
.PP
Note that multiple inheritance is also supported by simply naming multiple parent sections in a child\&. Parents are implicitly expanded in place in a child, and the last occurrence of each parameter takes precedence\&. For example,
.sp
.nf
define tapetype par1 {
    comment "Parent 1"
    filemark 8k
    speed 300bps
    length 200M
}
define tapetype par2 {
    comment "Parent 2"
    filemark 16k
    speed 400bps
}
define tapetype child {
    par1
    par2
    filemark 32k
}
.fi
In this example, \*(Aqchild\*(Aq will have a filemark of 32k, a speed of 400bps, and a length of 200M\&.
.SH "GLOBAL PARAMETERS"
.PP
\fBorg\fR \fIstring\fR
.RS 4
Default:
\fI"daily"\fR\&. A descriptive name for the configuration\&. This string appears in the Subject line of mail reports\&. Each Amanda configuration should have a different string to keep mail reports distinct\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBmailer\fR \fIstring\fR
.RS 4
Default found by configure\&. A mail program that can send mail with \*(Aq\fIMAILER \-s "subject" user < message_file\fR\*(Aq\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBmailto\fR \fIstring\fR
.RS 4
Default: none\&. A space separated list of recipients for mail reports\&. If not specified, amdump will not send any mail\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBsend\-amreport\-on\fR [ \fBall\fR | \fBstrange\fR | \fBerror\fR | \fBnever\fR ]
.RS 4
Default:
\fBall\fR\&. Specify which types of messages will trigger an email from amreport\&. amreport is used by amdump and amflush\&.
.PP
\fBall\fR
.RS 4
Send an email on any message\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBstrange\fR
.RS 4
Send an email on strange or error message\&. A strange message occurs when the dump succeeded, but returned one or more errors unknown to Amanda\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBerror\fR
.RS 4
Send an email only on error messages\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBnever\fR
.RS 4
Never send an email\&.
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fBmax\-dle\-by\-volume\fR \fIint\fR
.RS 4
Default:
\fI1000000000\fR\&. The maximum number of dle written to a single volume\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBdumpcycle\fR \fIint\fR
.RS 4
Default:
\fI10 days\fR\&. The number of days in the backup cycle\&. Each disk will get a full backup at least this often\&. Setting this to zero tries to do a full backup each run\&.
.if n \{\
.sp
.\}
.RS 4
.it 1 an-trap
.nr an-no-space-flag 1
.nr an-break-flag 1
.br
.ps +1
\fBNote\fR
.ps -1
.br
This parameter may also be set in a specific
\fBdumptype\fR
(see below)\&. This value sets the default for all
\fBdumptype\fRs so must appear in
\fBamanda\&.conf\fR
before any
\fBdumptype\fRs are defined\&.
.sp .5v
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fBrunspercycle\fR \fIint\fR
.RS 4
Default:
\fIsame as dumpcycle\fR\&. The number of amdump runs in
\fBdumpcycle\fR
days\&. A value of 0 means the same value as
\fBdumpcycle\fR\&. A value of \-1 means guess the number of runs from the
\fBtapelist\fR(5)
file, which is the number of tapes used in the last
\fBdumpcycle\fR
days /
\fBruntapes\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBtapecycle\fR \fIint\fR
.RS 4
Default:
\fI15 tapes\fR\&. Specifies the number of "active" volumes \- volumes that Amanda will not overwrite\&. While Amanda is always willing to write to a new volume, it refuses to overwrite a volume unless at least \*(Aq\fBtapecycle\fR
\-1\*(Aq volumes have been written since\&.
.sp
It is considered good administrative practice to set the
\fBtapecycle\fR
parameter slightly lower than the actual number of tapes in use\&. This allows the administrator to more easily cope with damaged or misplaced tapes or schedule adjustments that call for slight adjustments in the rotation order\&.
.sp
Note: Amanda is commonly misconfigured with
\fBtapecycle\fR
equal to the number of tapes per
\fBdumpcycle\fR\&. In this misconfiguration, amanda may erase a full dump before a new one is completed\&. Recovery is then impossible\&. The
\fBtapecycle\fR
must be at least one tape larger than the number of tapes per dumpcycle\&.
.sp
The number of tapes per dumpcycle is calculated by multiplying the number of
\fBamdump\fR
runs per dump cycle
\fBrunspercycle\fR
(the number of
\fBamdump\fR
runs per dump cycle) and
\fBruntapes\fR
(the number of tapes used per run)\&. Typically
\fBtapecycle\fR
is set to two or four times the tapes per dumpcycle\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBusetimestamps\fR \fIbool\fR
.RS 4
Default:
\fBYes\fR\&. This option allows Amanda to track multiple runs per calendar day\&. The only reason one might disable it is that Amanda versions before 2\&.5\&.1 can\*(Aqt read logfiles written when this option was enabled\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBlabel\-new\-tapes\fR \fIstring\fR
.RS 4
Deprecated, use
\fBautolabel\fR
option with options
\fBvolume\-error empty\fR
to get equivalent behavior\&.
.sp
Default: not set\&. When set, this directive will cause Amanda to automatically write an Amanda tape label to any blank tape she encounters\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBautolabel\fR \fIstring\fR [\fBany\fR] [\fBother\-config\fR] [\fBnon\-amanda\fR] [\fBvolume\-error\fR] [\fBempty\fR]
.RS 4
Default: not set\&. When set, this directive will cause Amanda to automatically write an Amanda tape label to most volume she encounters\&. This option is DANGEROUS because when set, Amanda may erase near\-failing tapes or tapes accidentally loaded in the wrong slot\&.
.sp
When using this directive, specify the template for new tape labels\&. The template can contains many variables that are substituted by their values:
.sp
.nf
    $c : config name
    $o : org configuration
    $b : barcode of the volume
    $s : slot number, can specify a minimun number of digit:
         $3s to get \*(Aq001\*(Aq
    $m : meta label
.fi
.sp
The template can contain some number of contiguous \*(Aq%\*(Aq characters, which will be replaced with a generated number\&. Be sure to specify enough \*(Aq%\*(Aq characters that you do not run out of tape labels\&. Example:
\fB"DailySet1\-%%%"\fR,
\fB"$c\-%%%"\fR,
\fB"$m\-%%%"\fR,
\fB"$m\-$b"\fR
.sp
The generared label can be used only if it match the
\fBlabelstr\fR
setting\&. The volume will not be used if the generated label doesn\*(Aqt match the
\fBlabelstr\fR
setting\&.
.sp
Note that many devices cannot distinguish an empty tape from an error condition, so it may is often necessary to include
\fBvolume\-error\fR
as an autolabel condition\&.
.PP
\fBany\fR
.RS 4
equivalent to \*(Aq\fBother\-config non\-amanda volume\-error empty\fR\*(Aq
.RE
.PP
\fBother\-config\fR
.RS 4
Label volumes with a valid Amanda label that do not match our
\fBlabelstr\fR\&. Danger: this may erase volumes
from other Amanda configurations without warning!
.RE
.PP
\fBnon\-amanda\fR
.RS 4
Label volumes which do not start with data that resembles an
Amanda header\&. Danger: this may erase volumes from other backup applications
without warning!
.RE
.PP
\fBvolume\-error\fR
.RS 4
Label volumes where an error occurs while trying to read the label\&.
Danger: this may erase arbitrary volumes due to transient errors\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBempty\fR
.RS 4
Label volumes where a read returns 0 bytes\&.
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fBmeta\-autolabel\fR \fIstring\fR
.RS 4
Default: not set\&. When set and if the changer support meta\-label, this directive will cause Amanda to automatically add a meta\-label to a meta\-volume\&.
.sp
A meta\-volume is a containers that contains many volumes, eg\&. a removable hard\-disk for use with chg\-disk, each hard disk have many slots (volume)\&. The meta\-label is the label to put on the meta\-volume\&.
.sp
When using this directive, specify the template for new meta labels\&. The template can contains many variables that are substituted by their values:
.sp
.nf
    $c : config name
    $o : org configuration
.fi
.sp
The template should contain some number of contiguous \*(Aq%\*(Aq characters, which will be replaced with a generated number\&. Be sure to specify enough \*(Aq%\*(Aq characters that you do not run out of meta labels\&. Example:
\fB"DailySet1\-%%%"\fR,
\fB"$o\-%%%"\fR,
.RE
.PP
\fBdumpuser\fR \fIstring\fR
.RS 4
Default:
\fI"amanda"\fR\&. The login name Amanda uses to run the backups\&. The backup client hosts must allow access from the tape server host as this user via
\fB\&.rhosts\fR
or
\fB\&.amandahosts\fR, depending on how the Amanda software was built\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBprinter\fR \fIstring\fR

Printer to use when doing tape labels\&. See the
\fBlbl\-templ\fR
\fBtapetype\fR
option\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBtapedev\fR \fIstring\fR
.RS 4
Default:
\fI"null:"\fR\&. This parameter can either specify a device (explicitly or by referencing a device definition \- see
\fBamanda-devices\fR(7)) or a tape changer (explicitly or by referencing a device definition \- see
\fBamanda-changers\fR(7))\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBdevice\-property\fR \fIstring\fR \fIstring\fR
.RS 4
These options can set various device properties\&. See
\fBamanda-devices\fR(7)
for more information on device properties and their syntax\&. Both strings are always quoted; the first string contains the name of the property to set, and the second contains its value\&. For example, to set a fixed block size of 128k, write:
.nf
device\-property "BLOCK_SIZE" "128k"
.fi
.RE
.PP
\fBproperty\fR [\fBappend\fR] \fIstring\fR \fIstring\fR+
.RS 4
These options can set various properties, they can be used by third party software to store information in the configuration file\&. Both strings are quoted; the first string contains the name of the property to set, and the others contains its values\&.
\fBappend\fR
keyword append the values to the list of values for that property\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBtpchanger\fR \fIstring\fR
.RS 4
Default: not set\&. The tape changer to use\&. In most cases, only one of
\fBtpchanger\fR
or
\fBtapedev\fR
is specified, although for backward compatibility both may be specified if
\fBtpchanger\fR
gives the name of an old changer script\&. See
\fBamanda-changers\fR(7)
for more information on configuring changers\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBinteractivity\fR \fIstring\fR

for a list of modules\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBchangerdev\fR \fIstring\fR

.RE
.PP
\fBruntapes\fR \fIint\fR
.RS 4
Default:
\fI1\fR\&. The maximum number of tapes used in a single run\&. If a tape changer is not configured, this option is not used and should be commented out of the configuration file\&.
.sp
If a tape changer is configured, this may be set larger than one to let Amanda write to more than one tape\&.
.sp
Note that this is an upper bound on the number of tapes, and Amanda may use less\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBmaxdumpsize\fR \fIint\fR
.RS 4
Default:
\fI\fBruntapes\fR\fR\fI*\fR\fI\fBtape\-length\fR\fR\&. Maximum number of bytes the planner will schedule for a run\&.

Default:
\fI"\&.*"\fR\&. The tape label constraint regular expression\&. All tape labels generated (see
\fBamlabel\fR(8)) and used by this configuration must match the regular expression\&. If multiple configurations are run from the same tape server host, it is helpful to set their labels to different strings (for example, "DAILY[0\-9][0\-9]*" vs\&.

.SH "DUMP SPLITTING CONFIGURATION"
.PP
Amanda can "split" dumps into parts while writing them to storage media\&. This allows Amanda to recover gracefully from a failure while writing a part to a volume, by simply selecting a new volume and re\-writing the dump from the beginning of the failed part\&. Parts also allow Amanda to seek directly to the required data, although this functionality is not yet used\&.
.PP
In order to support re\-writing from the beginning of a failed part, Amanda must have access to the contents of the part after it has been partially written\&. If the dump is being read from holding disk, then the part contents are availble there\&. Otherwise, the part must be cached, and this can be done memory or on disk\&. In either of the latter cases, the cache must have enough space to hold an entire part\&.
.PP
Because it is common for a single Amanda configuration to use both holding\-disk (FILE\-WRITE) and direct (known as PORT\-WRITE) dumps, Amanda allows the configuration of different split sizes for the two cases\&. This allows, for example, for a part size appropriate to large tapes when performing FILE\-WRITE dumps, with a part size limited by available disk or memory when performing PORT\-WRITE dumps\&.
.PP
Selecting a proper split size is a delicate matter\&. If the parts are too large, substantial storage space may be wasted in failed parts\&. If too small, large dumps will be split into innumerable tiny dumpfiles, adding to restoration complexity; furthermore, an excess of filemarks will cause slower tape drive operation and reduce the usable space on tape\&. A good rule of thumb is 1/10 of the size of a volume of storage media\&.
.PP
In versions of Amanda through 3\&.1\&.*, splitting was controlled by the dumptype parameters
\fBtape\-splitsize\fR,
\fBsplit\-diskbuffer\fR, and
\fBfallback\-splitsize\fR\&. These keywords had confusing and non\-intuitive interactions, and have since been deprecated\&.
.PP
If the deprecated keywords are not present, subsequent versions of Amanda use the dumptype parameter
\fBallow\-split\fR
to control whether a DLE can be split, and the
\fItapetype\fR
parameters
\fBpart\-size\fR,
\fBpart\-cache\-type\fR,
\fBpart\-cache\-dir\fR, and
\fBpart\-cache\-max\-size\fR\&. The
\fBpart\-size\fR
specifies the "normal" part size, while the
\fBpart\-cache\-*\fR
parameters describe how to behave when caching is required (on PORT\-WRITE)\&. Full details on these parameters are given above\&.
